#Tic Tac Toe Game

#Description
This is a simple console-based Tic Tac Toe game written in C++. The game allows two players to take turns marking the spaces on a 3x3 grid with their respective symbols (x and o). The first player to achieve three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, wins the game. If no player achieves a winning combination, the game ends in a draw.

#How to Play
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Compile the C++ code using a C++ compiler.
Run the compiled executable to start the game.
Players take turns entering the number of the square where they want to place their symbol.
The game ends when one player achieves a winning combination or when the board is full with no winner.
